 ### Set up database

  remember the root username and password during installing process  
  add the "bin" folder to path  
- Open cmd(windows) or terminal(mac) with ***admin*** access, run the command below  
  ```mysqld --console``` to start server  
- In another ***admin*** cmd or terminal, run the command below  
  ```mysql -u <your root username> -p```  
  ```<enter password at prompt>```  
  ```create user 'freeopenuniversity'@'localhost';``` I skipped password    
  ```grant all privileges on * . * to 'freeopenuniversity'@localhost;```  
  ```exit```  
  log in with the user just created  
  ```mysql -u freeopenuniversity```
